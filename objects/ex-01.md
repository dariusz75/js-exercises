####Your goal is to complete the addRanger function that takes in *location, name, skillz,* and *station* as parameters. Then we can pass in our *lighthouseRock* object as the *location* and start to add rangers.

1. As rangers are added, increment the number of rangers at the *location* using its *numRangers* property.
<br />
2. Add a property to the *location* using bracket notation that will be used to hold a ranger object. Specifically, each property will be named *ranger1, ranger2, ranger3,* etc. This will require string concatenation and the current value of the *numRangers* property.
<br />
3. Now that you have your *ranger<number> property*, assign an object literal to it that contains properties for *name, skillz,* and *station.* Then assign values to those properties using the parameters that we pass in.
<br />
4. Call your *addRanger* function three times with the appropriate arguments to add the following rangers, in order, to the *location*:
<br />

`
name: "Nick Walsh", skillz: "magnification burn", station: 2 
`

`
name: "Drew Barontini", skillz: "uppercut launch", station: 3 
`

`
name: "Christine Wong", skillz: "bomb defusing", station: 1 
`

####Starter code


```js
var superBlinders = [ ["Firestorm", 4000], ["Solar Death Ray", 6000], ["Supernova", 12000] ];

var lighthouseRock = {
  gateClosed: true,
  weaponBulbs: superBlinders,
  capacity: 30,
  secretPassageTo: "Underwater Outpost",
  numRangers: 0
};

function addRanger(location, name, skillz, station) {

// increment the number of rangers property
  
// add the ranger<number> property and assign a ranger object  

}

// call addRanger three times to add the new rangers
```

####Walkthrough

1. As rangers are added, increment the number of rangers at the *location* using its *numRangers* property.

```js
var superBlinders = [ ["Firestorm", 4000], ["Solar Death Ray", 6000], ["Supernova", 12000] ];

var lighthouseRock = {
  gateClosed: true,
  weaponBulbs: superBlinders,
  capacity: 30,
  secretPassageTo: "Underwater Outpost",
  numRangers: 0
};

function addRanger(location, name, skillz, station) {

// increment the number of rangers property
	location.numRangers++;

// add the ranger<number> property and assign a ranger object  

}

// call addRanger three times to add the new rangers
```

2. Add a property to the *location* using bracket notation that will be used to hold a ranger object. Specifically, each property will be named *ranger1, ranger2, ranger3,* etc. This will require string concatenation and the current value of the *numRangers* property. < /br>
This part is tricky. Basically we need to use bracket notation so that we can refer to the ranger numbers. The numRangers property is holding the current ranger number, and we can append that to the "ranger" string using bracket notation:

```js
var superBlinders = [ ["Firestorm", 4000], ["Solar Death Ray", 6000], ["Supernova", 12000] ];

var lighthouseRock = {
  gateClosed: true,
  weaponBulbs: superBlinders,
  capacity: 30,
  secretPassageTo: "Underwater Outpost",
  numRangers: 0
};

function addRanger(location, name, skillz, station) {

// increment the number of rangers property
	location.numRangers++;

// add the ranger<number> property and assign a ranger object 
	location["ranger" + location.numRangers] = {
    
  }; 

}

// call addRanger three times to add the new rangers
```

3. Now that you have your *ranger<number> property*, assign an object literal to it that contains properties for *name, skillz,* and *station.* Then assign values to those properties using the parameters that we pass in.
<br />

```js
var superBlinders = [ ["Firestorm", 4000], ["Solar Death Ray", 6000], ["Supernova", 12000] ];

var lighthouseRock = {
  gateClosed: true,
  weaponBulbs: superBlinders,
  capacity: 30,
  secretPassageTo: "Underwater Outpost",
  numRangers: 0
};

function addRanger(location, name, skillz, station) {

// increment the number of rangers property
	location.numRangers++;

// add the ranger<number> property and assign a ranger object 
	location["ranger" + location.numRangers] = {
												name: name,
												skillz: skillz,
												station: station
												}; 

}

// call addRanger three times to add the new rangers
```
4. Call your *addRanger* function three times with the appropriate arguments to add the following rangers, in order, to the *location*:

```js
var superBlinders = [ ["Firestorm", 4000], ["Solar Death Ray", 6000], ["Supernova", 12000] ];

var lighthouseRock = {
  gateClosed: true,
  weaponBulbs: superBlinders,
  capacity: 30,
  secretPassageTo: "Underwater Outpost",
  numRangers: 0
};

function addRanger(location, name, skillz, station) {

// increment the number of rangers property
	location.numRangers++;

// add the ranger<number> property and assign a ranger object 
	location["ranger" + location.numRangers] = {
												name: name,
												skillz: skillz,
												station: station
												}; 

}

// call addRanger three times to add the new rangers

addRanger(lighthouseRock, "Nick Walsh", "magnification burn", 2);
addRanger(lighthouseRock, "Drew Barontini", "uppercut launch", 3);
addRanger(lighthouseRock, "Christine Wong", "bomb defusing", 1);
```
