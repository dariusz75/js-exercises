####Your goal is to complete the addRanger function that takes in *location, name, skillz,* and *station* as parameters. Then we can pass in our *lighthouseRock* object as the *location* and start to add rangers.

1. As rangers are added, increment the number of rangers at the *location* using its *numRangers* property.
<br />
2. Add a property to the *location* using bracket notation that will be used to hold a ranger object. Specifically, each property will be named *ranger1, ranger2, ranger3,* etc. This will require string concatenation and the current value of the *numRangers* property.
<br />
3. Now that you have your *ranger<number> property*, assign an object literal to it that contains properties for *name, skillz,* and *station.* Then assign values to those properties using the parameters that we pass in.
<br />
4. Call your *addRanger* function three times with the appropriate arguments to add the following rangers, in order, to the *location*:
<br />

`
name: "Nick Walsh", skillz: "magnification burn", station: 2 
`

`
name: "Drew Barontini", skillz: "uppercut launch", station: 3 
`

`
name: "Christine Wong", skillz: "bomb defusing", station: 1 
`

####Example code


```js
var superBlinders = [ ["Firestorm", 4000], ["Solar Death Ray", 6000], ["Supernova", 12000] ];

var lighthouseRock = {
  gateClosed: true,
  weaponBulbs: superBlinders,
  capacity: 30,
  secretPassageTo: "Underwater Outpost",
  numRangers: 0
};

function addRanger(location, name, skillz, station) {

}
```
