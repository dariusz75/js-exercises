####This challenge is about the fact that we now have four rangers in our lighthouseRock object, but only have three bulbs in the superBlinders array. So we need a new way to add a bulb.
<br />
In other words, we're going to create an addBulb method inside the lighthouseRock object that will allow us to add another bulb to the array.
<br />
###Starter code:
<br />
```js
var superBlinders = [ ["Firestorm", 4000], ["Solar Death Ray", 6000], ["Supernova", 12000] ];

var lighthouseRock = {
  gateClosed: true,
  weaponBulbs: superBlinders,
  capacity: 30,
  secretPassageTo: "Underwater Outpost",
  numRangers: 3,
  ranger1: {name: "Nick Walsh", skillz: "magnification burn", station: 2},
  ranger2: {name: "Drew Barontini", skillz: "uppercut launch", station: 3},
  ranger3: {name: "Christine Wong", skillz: "bomb defusing", station: 1},
  ranger4: {name: "Jordan Wade", skillz: "dual-wield hand crossbow", station: 4},
  addRanger: function( name, skillz, station) {
              this.numRangers++;
              this["ranger" + this.numRangers] = {
                name: name,
                skillz: skillz,
                station: station
                };
              },
  
};
```
Rather than adding the method directly inside the lighthouseRock object, the challenge asks us to add it to the lighthouseRock object on the outside.
<br />
Create a new addBulb function property for the lighthouseRock object, but donâ€™t add it directly inside the object. Instead, add it on the outside of the lighthouseRock object. Pass in name and wattage as parameters.
<br />
In order to accomplish this, we need to use the lighthouseRock object and add the function as a property:

```js
lighthouseRock.addBulb = function(name, wattage) {
  
};
```
<br />
###pushing into the array

```js
lighthouseRock.addBulb = function(name, wattage) {
  weaponBulbs.push();
};
```
Since this method is actually a part of the lighthouseRock object, it means we're going to need to use this in order to refer to it properly:

```js
lighthouseRock.addBulb = function(name, wattage) {
  this.weaponBulbs.push();
};
```
<br />
Lastly, we just need to push the sub-array with the proper values from the parameters:
```js
lighthouseRock.addBulb = function(name, wattage) {
  this.weaponBulbs.push([name, wattage]);
};
```
<br />
####Solution
```js
var superBlinders = [ ["Firestorm", 4000], ["Solar Death Ray", 6000], ["Supernova", 12000] ];

var lighthouseRock = {
  gateClosed: true,
  weaponBulbs: superBlinders,
  capacity: 30,
  secretPassageTo: "Underwater Outpost",
  numRangers: 3,
  ranger1: {name: "Nick Walsh", skillz: "magnification burn", station: 2},
  ranger2: {name: "Drew Barontini", skillz: "uppercut launch", station: 3},
  ranger3: {name: "Christine Wong", skillz: "bomb defusing", station: 1},
  ranger4: {name: "Jordan Wade", skillz: "dual-wield hand crossbow", station: 4},
  addRanger: function( name, skillz, station) {
              this.numRangers++;
              this["ranger" + this.numRangers] = {
                name: name,
                skillz: skillz,
                station: station
                };
              },
  
};

lighthouseRock.addBulb = function(name, wattage) {
  this.weaponBulbs.push([name, wattage]);
};

lighthouseRock.addBulb('Nova', 222);
console.log(superBlinders);
```
